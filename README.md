# FluiDB

> JSON objects as an invisible flat file database with low overhead.

### Installation

Install via npm.

`npm install fluidb`

### Example

Normally, when using and storing JSON data in a file, you do something like this.

```
const fs = require('fs'),
jsonObj = fs.existsSync(path) ? JSON.parse(fs.readFileSync('./db.json', 'utf-8')) : {};

jsonObj[someKey] = someValue;
fs.writeFileSync("./db.json", JSON.stringify(jsonObj));
```

In the example above, we have to require fs, init our object from scratch or from an existing file, then after updating our object, we have to manually dump it back to the file. Anytime we change or add a property to the object, we need to remember to dump it.

With fluiDB, all we have to do is initialize our object, and we're good to go.

```
const jsonObj = new require('fluidb')();

jsonObj[someKey] = someValue;
```

Loading and handling the file is done invisibly by fluidb, and you never notice you're working with fluidb -- no code has to be rewritten aside from the initialization.  Most importantly, we never have to write back to the file manually. fluiDB takes care of it.

##### Multiple Databases

fluidb takes two arguments -- the database name, and an object you want to initialize it to. If you want to use multiple databases, just initialize it with `new db('someName')`. If you want to both use multiple databases (or a custom filename) and pass an object, you can do that as well using `new db('someName', someObject)`.

##### Clearing Objects
Due to the lack of support for destructors, do *not* clear or reinitialize your object using `jsonObj = {}` -- instead, use `jsonObj = new db({})` or `jsonObj = new db('someName', {})`.
